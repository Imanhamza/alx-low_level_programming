## Tasks

0. [Positive anything is better than negative nothing](./0-positive_or_negative.c) : This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
  * You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)
  * The variable `n` will store a different value every time you will run this program
  * You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code
  * The output of the program should be:
    - The number, followed by
      * if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
      * if the number is 0: `is zero`
      * if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    - followed by a new line
1. [The last digit](./1-last_digit.c) : This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
