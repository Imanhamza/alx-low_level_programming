### File Structure
|**File**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|[Is upper](./0-isupper.c)| A function that checks for uppercase character.|
|[Is digit](./1-isdigit.c)| A function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).|
|[Collaboration is multiplication](./2-mul.c)| A function that multiplies two integers.|
|[The numbers speak for themselves](./3-print_numbers.c)| A function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`.|
|[I believe in numbers and signs](./4-print_most_numbers.c)| A function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9` without `2` and `4`.|
|[Numbers are universal language](./5-more_numbers.c)| A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`.|
|[A straight line](./6-print_line.c)| A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.|
|[A diagonal line](./7-print_diagonal.c)| A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.|
|[Square](./8-print_square.c)| A  function that prints a square.|
|[Fizz-Buzz](./9-fizz_buzz.c)| A program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.|
|[Triangles](./10-print_triangle.c)| A function that prints a triangle.|
|[Prime numbers](./100-prime_factor.c)| A program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`.|
|[Numbers have life](./101-print_number.c)| A function that prints an integer.|
